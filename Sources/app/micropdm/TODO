Missing functionality for parity:
  ☐ power down in standby mode when KL15 goes away
  ☐ configure over CAN
    ☐ how does this work? force button off?
  ☐ bus speed change over CAN
  ☐ use calibration data
  ☐ multiple buttons -> 1 output
    ☐ how does this work? OR of all buttons? example implies low/high can be implemented
  ☐ ignition button 'breathe' in Standby
  ☐ suppress CAN output in Standby

Bugs:
  ✘ 'smart' flashing doesn't play well with the backlight @cancelled (21-07-19 21:38)
    - you can't turn a key "off" while the backlight is on, you just get the backlight color instead, so flashing magenta with a magenta backlight is just solid magenta
    - so don't; use explicit key settings instead


Enhancements:
  ☐ smart(er) port current monitoring
  ☐ pwm output

Test tool:
  ☐ console
  ☐ remote button press/release
  ☐ status display

Questions:
  - How does multiple-switches-one-output work?
