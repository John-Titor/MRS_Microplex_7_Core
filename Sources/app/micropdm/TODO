Missing functionality for parity:
  ☐ power down in standby mode when KL15 goes away
  ☐ configure over CAN
    ☐ how does this work? force button off?
  ☐ bus speed change over CAN
  ☐ use calibration data
  ☐ multiple buttons -> 1 output
    ☐ how does this work? OR of all buttons? example implies low/high can be implemented
  ☐ ignition button 'breathe' in Standby
  ☐ suppress CAN output in Standby

Bugs:
  ✔ 'smart' flashing doesn't play well with the backlight @done (21-07-20 00:03)
    - you can't turn a key "off" while the backlight is on, you just get the backlight color instead
    - keypad-managed blink is probably smarter
    - use explicit key settings instead


Enhancements:
  ☐ do full keypad config at startup
  ☐ smart(er) port current monitoring
  ☐ pwm output
  ☐ 'feature' bits in config
  ☐ node ID in config for > 1 extender
  ☐ use one of the EEPROM parameters so MRS config tool can edit features?
  ☐ controller / extender 'feature'
  ☐ limp mode
    - detect keypad / remote management commands stopped sending
    - configurable output state
  ☐ wake-on-CAN for extenders
  ☐ multiple keypads

Test tool:
  ☐ console
  ☐ interactive mode
  ☐ script mode
  ☐ remote button press/release
  ☐ status display (outputs, button LEDs, backlight, etc)
  ☐ EEPROM read/write
  ☐ remote reset

Questions:
  - How does multiple-switches-one-output work?
